### SSL
Some wallets require that the website within which it runs be using a https 
connection. If you are testing one of these wallets, Ledger is one, then you have
two options:
 1. Setup a valid certificate for localhost using [this guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-set-up-https-locally-with-create-react-app/).
 2. Allow invalid certificates for resources loaded from localhost by navigating here within a chrome based browser: [chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost](chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost)
